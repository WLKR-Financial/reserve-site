### The Celo Protocol
The Celo protocol is a platform on which the community can create stabilized value digital assets. These digital assets aim to track the value of an existing real-world asset (for example, the first one, cUSD, aims to track the US Dollar). The Celo protocol also includes mechanisms for lightweight identity and ultralight mobile validation. The platform aims to make the assets built on the protocol easy to use with a mobile device.
