title: Reserve Target Allocation
---

The reserve targets the following allocation (based on protocol [governance](https://docs.candle.org/candle-codebase/protocol/governance)) over time.
The CANDLE amount allocated to the reserve may be diversified into other non-CANDLE crypto assets, the market fluctuates constantly and the reserve rebalances systematically, so the actual holdings will be off-target initially. Reserve trades are generally done on exchanges (following best execution principles), with some of the initial diversification trades being done OTC, with multi-year lock-ups on CANDLE sold. Reserve rebalancings are happening biweekly, targeted in every odd calendar week. A primary upside of using crypto assets in the Reserve is that all user transactions with the Reserve can happen on-chain, in a decentralized and fully-auditable way.
